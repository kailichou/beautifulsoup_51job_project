	⁃	For masOS and Unix users, you can create a cron program.
           ###Build a new, empty crontab file at a Terminal window
           touch crontab_file.txt
           ###Add a cron job to the crontab file
           crontab crontab_file.txt
           ###Enter code below and paste the cron job to the file
           crontab -e
           0 0 20 2 1 /Users/kailic/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Projects/DS/Web Scrapping/tester.py
            
          ###Done. Or you want to delete this cron program later
          rm crontab_file.txt
